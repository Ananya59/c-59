    <section id="bio">
    <p> Art is my hobby.I love doing some paining or drawing.I also like to shop some art supplies.I like trying out different art forms/trends.I like to paint with water colours a lot and am good at it.I like taking workshops that are related to art , like sketching or even brush calligraphy.My favourite artist is Vincent van Gogh.Van Gogh is known for being psychologically unstable, but his arts are among the most popular and most famous artists of all time. Van Goghâ€™s technique of painting with flurries of thick brushstrokes made up of vivid colours squeezed straight from the tube would inspire subsequent generations of artists.</p>
